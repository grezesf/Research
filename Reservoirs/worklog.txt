    mdp library installed on cougar
    PYTHONPATH finally edited for OGER library import
    still can get test/grammar_task.py to run?
    added description on feat_extract.py
    remakeMFCCs.py fixed and working

    Moved the work to new github
    Tested out OGER tests
        need to fix mdp and OGER library issues

    Tested out preprocessing scripts
        connections to cats machines unstable
        feat_extract.py works
        rescalling.py works
